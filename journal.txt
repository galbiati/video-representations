Model output remains grid of 3x3 grey rectangles. Observations so far:
- grid is sharper using linear/relu/selu output units than tanh out
- grid is not unique to training data; on fake data (movies of a static white diagonal of pixels), it still outputs the grid of rectangles
- the problem does not appear to be with the LSTM; a regular autoencoder without the intervening units exhibits the same pathology

This smells like a bug - possibly another dtype or encoding error. I previously checked that the videos can be correctly reconstructed from the .tfrecords files, which they can.

I'm going to switch gears and begin unloading functions from the notebook, which has become unwieldy. Maybe as I deconstruct code, I will find the bug...
